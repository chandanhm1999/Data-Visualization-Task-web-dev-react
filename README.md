Data Visualization Task MANUFAC

## Task description:
1. You are expected to implement a line chart and bar chart using React and ECharts for
React. The entire source code should be in TypeScript. For learning more about ECharts,
this link can also be useful.
2. Wine Data Set to be used for visualization.
3. Line Chart to be drawn between “Flavanoids” on the horizontal axis and “Ash” on the
vertical axis. The axes should be labeled.
4. Bar chart to be drawn showing the “Alcohol” categories on the horizontal axis and the
minimum “Magnesium” value for each alcohol category on the vertical axis. The axes
should be labeled.
5. In the final product, upon running yarn start, the browser should open with the desired
charts rendered.

Project completed with The help of ECharts for React!

# React JS

## Getting Started with Create React App
#This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

> Get the code

git clone 

## Project setup
```
yarn create react-app my-app
```

## Install the project dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

### Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:
```
yarn start
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
Runs the app in the development mode.\
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
yarn test
```
##The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://reactjs.org/).

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
```
yarn eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
